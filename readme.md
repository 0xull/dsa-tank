# DSA Tank

Another DSA drill, but more structured than before. This is the third time I'm committing myself to the lifestyle of problem-solving, and I want a well-documented approach to it. How else can I prove myself than having the knowledge, as well as a documentation for it all. This is also an excuse to immerse myself further into the lifstyle of writing and documentation as I approach that level in my career.

## Repository content

This repository will contain everything from basic data structure implementations to advanced ones, likewise for algorithms. The aim is to explore as many problem sets as possible and document them here. Oh yeah, that includes math. I'm about the life of math as well, being an undergrad degree holder in it. So, you might also see screenshots of my math notes.

## Contributing

Thank you, but no code contributions. If you find a mistake (harmless or harmful), feel free to document it in the issues. I don't mind if you want to vent while at it.
