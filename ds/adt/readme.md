# **1. Introduction to Abstract Data Types (ADT)**

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a conceptual model that defines:

* The *data* it stores.
* The *operations* that can be performed on it.
* But **not** how the data is organized or the operations are implemented.

The primary goal of an ADT is to provide an abstract view of data manipulation without concerning the underlying implementation details.
